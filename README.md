# TAXMAN
*Practice Ruby project to compute estimated 2016 income taxes*    

The current program will take gross income and filing status and compute estimated 2016 Federal Income Tax due.

The calculation considers:
+ Personal exemption(s)
+ Standard deduction
+ Estimated 2016 brackets
+ Phase out of personal exemption(s)

The calculation does not consider:
+ Income not taxed at ordinary rate (e.g., Qualified Dividends)
+ Tax Credits
+ Federal Withholding
+ Additional deductions
+ Dependents
+ And the rest of the vast abyss of the tax code

This is an ongoing project, and I plan to address many of the current limitations as I continue to improve the program.
